## UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM 
### THE EFFECTS OF COVID ON THE ELDERLY

  Since March of 2020, life has been extremely different for everybody. It started off as 2 weeks of isolation and measures being put in place to protect ourselves. However, time flew by and it has now been 2 years. Over the past year, some of the restrictions started to get lifted. Kids and teenagers resumed in person learning from at their high schools and elementary schools. Adults have started going back to university campuses as well as their offices. However, there is one age group that still has to take the situation very seriously. The elderly population is still greatly at risk and hasnâ€™t had the luxury of life going back to normal as the other age groups have. The elderly were already extremely cautious with how often they would leave their homes and the rise of the contagious Omicron variable has made them even more stressed about the situation.


  As previously mentioned, the elderly have had to stay inside their homes for the greater part of the past 2 years. It may be the case that they choose to do the same for a bit longer due to the wave of the Omicron variant. We will be taking a look at 2 negative side effects that the pandemic has had on the elderly. The first is that they have had to reduce their social interaction. The constant fear for their health has led to limiting any physical visits with friends and family. This has led them to miss many of their friends and family members, hoping for an easy way to interact with those they cherish. The lockdown has also played a negative effect on their health. Staying at home has developed into a routine reducing their desire to go out and exercise. Not exercising for an extended period of time only increases the speed at which the effects of aging can occur. There must be a way to get the elderly to increase social interaction and exercising all while being in a safe environment to not risk their health.
  
## USER RESEARCH
 
 We decided to use questionnaires to gather our user data. We did so using Google Forms and asked a variety of questions. The style of questions that were used include closed questions, open questions, and Likert scale questions. We asked our users about a variety of subjects such as physical activity, stress, and how they interact with technology/social media. Google Forms then provided us with data based on the answers.  In total, 10 participants answered the questionnaire. Below, we will be presenting the data that we found the most useful for designing our various models (ex. user personas, user journeys, wireframes, etc.). The consent signatures can be found in the appendix.
 
## RESEARCH RESULTS
 
 The first notable result from the questionnaire is that 100% of our participants have noticed an increase in stress since the pandemic. This solidifies the current need of a stress-relieving product for elders.

 Next, there is a significant decrease in overall activity since the quarantine started. Although this data is not enough to state that the decrease in activity induces stress, it is strong evidence towards a correlation between inactivity and stress. This information shapes a key concept of our product: activity incentivization. It also relates to the task at hand which is to create an application that improve elders' physical and mental wellbeing. By encouraging elders to exercise, we improve both their physical and psychological state.

![Activity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giroux2000/SOEN357_Mini_Project/gh-pages/activity.png 'activity')

 We found that most participants had not participated in online classes. However, the few that did rated their experience as being either "average" or "above average". Also, a third of our participants expressed interest in the idea of online classes. This tells us that organizing online classes in our application may be an interesting prospect for our product. One participant mentioned wishing online classes were more flexible, so multiple hours and schedules will be a priority in this section of our product.

 We also found that our users' favourite activities are either walking or full-body movements. Our application will thus focus on these activities. Although there were many different complaints about different applications, we found that the single most common problem was poor usability. As such, user friendliness will be a major focus of our product. Also, the data shows that a third of elders communicate at most monthly with other family or friends. Again, this may be correlated with the increase in stress levels mentioned earlier. Our application will thus encourage social interaction.

![Usability](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giroux2000/SOEN357_Mini_Project/gh-pages/usability.png 'usability')

 Finally, although no common websites have been identified as being aesthetically pleasing, Facebook was mentioned by a third of our respondents as being the easiest to use. The social media application will thus serve as a guide to ensure user-friendliness in our product.

## USER REQUIREMENTS

 The information gathered from our questionnaires defines our user requirements. Our users need an application that incentivizes activity and social interaction to reduce their stress levels. They want something that is easily usable and that ideally encourages walking or full-body movements as exercises. They also want flexible schedules. In the following sections, we will investigate user personas, journeys and empathy maps to define our user goals.
 
## REASONING FOR CHOSEN TOOLS
 
 First, it is important to rationalize the usage of personas, journeys and empathy maps. Initially, user personas tells us a little bit of who our target audience is, but they are not adequate when it comes to deeper understanding and extensively reporting their attitudes, their well-being, their daily life and their physical state. Using both user personas and empathy maps ensures completeness of our user goals and understanding of the problem. First, we specify the elders we target and find patterns on their goals, their background, their personalities, their frustrations, their motivations, concerns, etc. Once we know the specific group that we are targeting, we can delve deeper and use the information we gathered through our research to summarize what they said and did, as well as what we believe they were thinking and feeling. Doing this gives us a more accurate understanding of their perspective and a clearer path towards what our user goals should be. Synthesized in the gains and pains section of the empathy map we created are the goals, the needs we strive to fulfill with our product.

Having a general overview of our target audience, a deeper understanding of their perspectives and the knowledge of their needs, we can start imagining the workings. This is where the user journeys come into play. It gives us the general idea of how elders will use our product, it tells us how their feelings will change and how their needs will be fulfilled with our application.

## USER PERSONAS

We chose to develop user personas as they help us get a better understanding of the stakeholders and what exactly it is that they want from our product. They allow us to see a person and how they would want to use our product in their everyday lives. Implementing fictional user personas will also allow us to draw parallels to people that we have met throughout our lives and think about what they would want out of this kind of product. Finally, it allows the team to think about different views that people may have on the product. It is easy for a team to think about what is optimal and makes the most sense to them, however, users are unique and have opinions that will stray from those of the design team.

### USER PERSONA 1: THOMAS CLARK, THE PRESCIENT

Thomas Clark is a well established business man. He has a very well paying job and a loving family. However, he's starting to notice new aches and pains as he slowly feels age creeping up on him. Thomas wants to start exercising so that he can keep his body in shape as he starts to age. Thomas grew up exercising in groups with his friends so he would love to get them involved in any way that he can. Here is a bit more about Thomas in his user persona:

### USER PERSONA 2: CHARLOTTE WALKER, THE COMFORTABLE

Charlotte Walker is a retired woman in her late sixties. She is divorced and has been very cautious in terms of physical contact throughout the pandemic. This means that she has barely been able to see her friends over the last two years. The isolation has made Charlotte extremely lonely and she wishes to be able to see her friends again while making sure that everyone stays safe. We delve further into who Charlotte is in her user persona: 

![User Persona 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giroux2000/SOEN357_Mini_Project/gh-pages/up2-1.png 'up2')

### USER PERSONA 3: CHARLES TRENT, THE LIFELONG ADVENTURER

Charles Trent is a cashier who has settled down in Florida. Charles is a married man who spent his entire life moving from city to city with his wife since they love to explore and meet new people. However, since they are now in their sixties, they have decided to maintain a more sedentary lifestyle. The Covid restrictions have limited the amount of people that Charles can meet and interact with on a daily basis. Charles hopes to find a way to meet new people as staying inside all this time has started to bore him. Find out more about Charles in his user persona:

### EMPATHY MAP

 The empathy map gives us a negative but realistic overview of the situation that too many elders have found themselves to be stuck in during the pandemic. Notably, they are socially isolated, they live routine-heavy sedentary and inactive lifestyles, they see and hear only negative or mundane things around them and they miss the way they used to live before quarantine started.

![Empathy map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giroux2000/SOEN357_Mini_Project/gh-pages/empathy.png 'empathy')

### USER GOALS

Having built user personas and an empathy map, it is now possible to define the user goals. These goals are defined in the "goals" section of the user personas and the "gains" section of the empathy map. To summarize, our product should help elders return to a healthier, busier and more active lifestyle, help elders interact with family, friends and new people, and help elders relieve stress. These goals, or end results, match the user requirements mentioned previously. 

## USER JOURNEYS

### USER JOURNEY 1: THOMAS CLARK

This user journey will look at accomplishing one of Thomas Clark's goals. The goal that we have selected to simulate is Thomas' goal to reconnect with friends as well as getting in shape. As we saw in our studies, not many people have been communicating with friends and family on a consistent basis throughout the pandemic. We also saw that their activity levels have dropped significantly indicating that this would be a great mix of user goals to simulate as it represents the vast majority of our users.

![User Journey 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giroux2000/SOEN357_Mini_Project/gh-pages/uj1.png 'uj1')

### USER JOURNEY 2: CHARLOTTE WALKER

Charlotte's user journey will look to reconnect with friends much like Thomas', however, in a different way. Some of the elders may not want to do exercise and would prefer to just be able to message and video chat with their friends. We decided that this would be a good user goal to simulate as many of the people we surveyed indicated that they have already used apps such as Facebook and Instagram. If we can include a messaging system similar to these applications, it may incentivize more people to use the app.

![User Journey 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giroux2000/SOEN357_Mini_Project/gh-pages/uj2.png 'uj2')

### USER JOURNEY 3: CHARLES TRENT

Charles' user journey will differ from the previous two. Instead of trying to reconnect with people he already knows, Charles will be trying to meet new people. The previous 2 user journey seem to cover all the information that we were able to get from the survey so we used the information to derive a new user goal. We saw that the average person does not interact with friends and family members through social media too often. This may be due to the fact that their friends and family don't use social media as much as they do so it would be hard to get these users to use the app. We thought that we could incentivize these users to try the app if they would be able to meet new people instead of interacting with people they already know.
